  <h1 align="center" style="font-size: 48px;">üìõ Flutter Mentions</h1>
  <h5 align="center">A simple flutter input widget to add <code>@</code> mentions functionality to your app</h5>
</p>

## Install üì¶

To use this package, add `flutter_mentions` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

You will need to add `flutter_mentions` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_mentions: ^0.0.1
```

Then, run `flutter packages get` in your terminal.

## Usage üíª

To use this package you must first wrap your top most widget with `Portal` as this package uses `flutter_portal` to show the suggestions list.

> [Portal], is the equivalent of [Overlay].
>
>  This widget will need to be inserted above the widget that needs to render
>  _under_ your overlays.
>
>  If you want to display your overlays on the top of _everything_, a good place
>  to insert that [Portal] is above `MaterialApp`:
>
>  ```dart
>  Portal(
>    child: MaterialApp(
>      ...
>    )
>  );
>  ```
>
>  (works for `CupertinoApp` too)
>
>  This way [Portal] will render above everything. But you could place it
>  somewhere else to change the clip behavior.
